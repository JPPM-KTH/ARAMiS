# ARAMiS
This repository includes to code **ARAMiS** (**A**coustic **R**esponse of **A**nisotropic **M**ult**i**layered **S**tructures).  It is a tool to calculate the transmission loss, reflection coefficient, or absorption coefficient of any given structure multilayered structure.
This code has been created as an outcome of the Ph.D. thesis entitled "On multilayered system dynamics and waves in anisotropic poroelastic meia" by Juan Parra. The Ph.D. project was done as an international cotutelle between KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Stockholm, Sweden), and Le Mans Universit√© (Le Mans, France).
